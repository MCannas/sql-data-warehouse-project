Design the Layers (Bronze, Silver & Gold)

Bronze Layer.

Definition:row, unprocessed data as-is from sources.
N
Objectives: traceability & debugging.

Object Types: tables.

Load Method: full load (truncate & insert).

Data Transformation: non as-is.

Data Modeling: none (as-is).

Target Audience:  data engineers.


Silver Layer.

Definition: clean and standarized data.

Objectives: intermediate layer. Prepare data for analysis.

Object Types: tables

Load Method: full load (truncate & insert).

Data Transformation: derived columns, data cleaning, stardarization, normalization, enrichment.

Data Modeling: none (as-is).

Target Audience: data analysts & data engineers.


Gold Layer.

Definition: business-ready data.

Objectives: provide data to be consumed for reporting & analytics.


Object Types: views.

Load Method: none

Data Transformation: data integration & aggregation. Business logic & rules.

Data Modeling: star schema. Aggregated objects. Flat tables

Target Audience: data analysts & business users.


Separation of concerns (SOC)

continue at: 56:55 (Naming Convention of the project)

Use the snake_case (all underscore characters with an underscore to connedct all)
Language: Use English for all names
Avoid Reserved Words: Do not use SQL reserved words as object names

Table Naming Convention (Bronze & Silver layer)

	<sourcesystem>: Name of the source system (e.g., crm, erp)
	<entity>: Exact table name from the source system.
	Example: crm_customer_info --> Customer information from the CRM system.

Table Naming Convention (Gold layer)
All names must use meaningful, business-aligned names for tables, starting with the category prefix.
<caterogry>_<entity>
	<caterogry>: Describes the role of the table, such as dim (dimention) or fact (fact table)
	<entity>: Descriptive name of the table, aligned with the business domain (e.g., customers, products, sales).
	Example: 
		dim_customers --> Dimention table for customer data.
		fact_sales --> Fact table containing sales transactions.

Glossary of Category Patterns
Pattern	Meaning			Example(s)
dim_	Dimention table		dim_customer, dim_product
fact_	Fact table		fact_sales
agg_	Aggregated table	agg_customers, agg_sales_monthly

Column Naming Conventions

Surrogate Keys
All primary keys in dimentions tables must use the suffix _key.
<table_name>_key
	<table_name>: Refers to the name of the table or entity the key belongs to.
	_key: A suffix indicating that this column is a surrogate key.
	Example: customer_key --> Surrogate key in the dim_customer table.

	
Technical Columns
All technical columns must start with the prefix dwh_, followed by a descriptive name indicating the column's purpose.
dwh_<column_name>
	dwh : Prefix exclusively for system-generated metadata.
	<column_name>: Descriptive name indicating the column's purpose.
	Example: dwh_load_date -> System-generated column ued to store the data when the record was loaded.

Stored Procedure
All stored procedures used for loading data must follow the naming pattern: load_<layer>.
	<layer>: Represents the layer being loaded, such as bronze, silver, or gold.
	Example:
		load_bronze -> Stored procedure for loading data into the Bronze layer.
		load_silver -> Stored procedure for loading data into the silver layer.
