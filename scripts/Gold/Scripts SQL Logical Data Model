Theory
Star Schema vs. Snowflake Schema
Star Schema: Simple & Easy with Big Dimensions.
Snowflake Schema: More Complex with Large Datasets.

Dimension: Descriptive information that give context to your data (Who? What? Where?).
Fact: Quantitative information that represents events (How much? How many?).

Explore the Business Objects.


Draw the logical datamodel for the gold layer.
Red: PRODUCT business Object.
Green: CUSTOMER business Object.
PURPLE: SALES business Object.
